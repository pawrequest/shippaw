this is what should happen:

1) each potential_collection_date in available_dates is  converted to a date-object using parse and assigned to potential_date

2) for each potential_collection_date ion available_dates::
           a) potential_date is converted into a human readable version called potential_date_hr
           b) if send_date matches potential_date then:
               i)  modify potential_date_hr to equal "f"Send Date Match : {potential_date_hr}"
               ii) set self.shipment.date to potential_date
               iii) set chosen_date_hr to potential_date_hr
           c) if no potential_collectioin_datye matches send_date then:
               i) set self.shipment.date to avaiulable_dates[0]
               i) set chosen_date_hr to available_dates[0
